## What is Senior-IPI ?
The Senior International Prognostic Index (Senior-IPI) is a prognostic tool designed specifically for elderly patients (≥80 years of age) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
It helps clinicians estimate survival outcomes and guides treatment decisions by stratifying patients into different risk groups based on several clinical factors shared with IPI and NCCN-IPI prognostic indexes.
